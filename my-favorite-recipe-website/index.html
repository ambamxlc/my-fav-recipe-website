    <H1>TACOS</H1>
    <P>Tacos are my favorite food! They are popular globally and can be found in many variations in places all over the world. In my Mexican culture, tacos are very popular and commonly eaten. Typically tacos have a tortilla that encloses a filling of some sort. The filling can be literally anything that's edible. Personally I like a basic taco with meat, onions, clinatro, and a sauce. I also prefer a corn tortilla. One of my favorite aspects of tacos is the sauce because the sauce can be anything. Personally I prefer a homemade green sauce or a homemade red sauce (or both haha). I prefer the sauce to be spicy...the spicier the better. Otherwise if no homemade sauce is available then I will go with a bottle brand. Tacos are also very versatile in that they can be eaten any time of the day- breakfast, brunch, lunch, dinner, etc. <b>TACOS RULE!!!!</b></P>
